## BareMetalCode's Anvil Home

Home of [BareMetalCode's Anvil](https://www.bmc-anvil.com/) Showcase Project

### Intro:
**BMC's Anvil** aims to / will be (or maybe when you are reading this... actually is...) a fully functioning project management tool.

This GitHub Organization hosts all repositories that give life to the project.

### Contribution guidelines:
Momentarily closed to contributions.

### Resources:
This is also a teaching project (maybe only teaching me...), showcasing techniques in dev, devops, infra, etc.

I set up a site describing a little bit of the journey, decisions made, bibliography, etc.: https://www.bmc-anvil.com/
